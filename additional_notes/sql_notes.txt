Here are some example of SQL statemenst I pulled from devhints.

Select Statement

    SELECT * FROM table
    SELECT * FROM table1, table2, ...
    SELECT field1, field2, ... FROM table1, table2, ...
    SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE condition
    SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE condition GROUPBY field
    SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE condition GROUPBY field HAVING condition2
    SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE condition ORDER BY field1, field2
    SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE condition ORDER BY field1, field2 DESC
    SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE condition LIMIT 10
    SELECT DISTINCT field1 FROM ...
    SELECT DISTINCT field1, field2 FROM ...

Insert Statement

    INSERT INTO table1 (field1, field2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...)

Update Statement

    UPDATE table1 SET field1=new_value1 WHERE condition
    UPDATE table1, table2 SET field1=new_value1, field2=new_value2, ... WHERE
    table1.id1 = table2.id2 AND condition

Delete Statement

    DELETE FROM table1 / TRUNCATE table1
    DELETE FROM table1 WHERE condition
    DELETE FROM table1, table2 FROM table1, table2 WHERE table1.id1 =
    table2.id2 AND condition
